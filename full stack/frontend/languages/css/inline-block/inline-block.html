    <h1><u>Display Property</u></h1>
    <span>
        The display property in CSS is a very useful and commonly used property that contains many values. 
        The display property defines how an HTML element should be displayed on the webpage. 
        The property also specifies the type of box used for an HTML element and how it should be laid out on the page. 
        If we need to display the elements that are laid out as inline elements, or laid out as inline-level block containers, then the display: inline and display: inline-block properties will be implemented. 
        In this article, we will see the display property, along with understanding the 2 different property values for the display property, i.e., the display:inline and display:inline-block property, among several other properties, & finally, will understand their basic differences & implementation through the examples.

<h2><u>display: inline</u></h2>
This property is used to display an element as an inline element (like span). 
The height and width properties are not affected on display: inline; property. It allows only the left and right sides of margins, not the top, and bottom. 
In simple words, it has no line break before and after its neighbor elements and it allows HTML next to it.
 When the element is declared with display: inline property, then it is treated as an inline element that will not start on a new line. 
 Inline elements also cannot have a width, height, margin, or padding applied to them.
 <h2><u>display: block</u></h2>
 This property is used to display an element as an inline-level block container. 
 The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but it can apply height and width values. 
 It is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content).
 It looks like an inline element but it behaves as a block element and doesnâ€™t force to line break. 
 It allows having a block-level appearance while still being laid out inline with other elements.
