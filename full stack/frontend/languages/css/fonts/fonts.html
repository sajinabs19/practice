    <p id="abc">Font Selection is Important
        Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website.
        
        The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.
        
        Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. 
        It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.<br>
        Generic Font Families
In CSS there are five generic font families:

Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families.
