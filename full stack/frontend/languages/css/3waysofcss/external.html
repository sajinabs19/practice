    <h1><u>External css</u></h1><br>
   <p> External CSS is a form of CSS which is used to add styling to multiple HTML pages at a time. It helps to design the layout of many HTML web pages simultaneously.
     The external CSS is always saved with the . css extension, and through this file, we can change the complete style of our HTML web page.
    With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!<br>

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the link element, inside the head section.
