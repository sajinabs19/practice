    <h1>TYPE SCRIPT</h1>
    <P>TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the way you really want to. 
        TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. 
        TypeScript is pure object oriented with classes, interfaces and statically typed like C# or Java. 
        The popular JavaScript framework Angular 2.0 is written in TypeScript.
         Mastering TypeScript can help programmers to write object-oriented programs and have them compiled to JavaScript, both on server side and client side.
         Programmers coming from Object Oriented world will find it easy to use TypeScript.
          With the knowledge of TypeScript, they can build web applications much faster, as TypeScript has good tooling support.
