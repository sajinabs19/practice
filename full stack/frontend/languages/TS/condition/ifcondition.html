        Conditional Statements
Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

The if Statement
Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.

Syntax
if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

example:you can vote or not
if(age>18)
{
    
}
    </p>
