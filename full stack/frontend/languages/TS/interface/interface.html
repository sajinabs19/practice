    <h1>INTERFACE</h1>
    <P>
        Object interfaces allow you to create code that specifies which methods a class must implement, without having to define how these methods are implemented.
         Interfaces share a namespace with classes and traits, so they may not use the same name.

        In practice, interfaces serve two complementary purposes:
        
        To allow developers to create objects of different classes that may be used interchangeably because they implement the same interface or interfaces.
         A common example is multiple database access services, multiple payment gateways, or different caching strategies. 
        Different implementations may be swapped out without requiring any changes to the code that uses them.
        To allow a function or method to accept and operate on a parameter that conforms to an interface, while not caring what else the object may do or how it is implemented. 
        These interfaces are often named like Iterable, Cacheable, Renderable, or so on to describe the significance of the behavior.
