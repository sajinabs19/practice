    <h1>HOC Function</h1>
    <p>
    Higher-order components or HOC is the advanced method of reusing the component functionality logic. 
    It simply takes the original component and returns the enhanced component
    It is also known as HOC. In React, HOC is an advanced technique for reusing component logic. It is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. 
    According to the official website, it is not the feature(part) in React API, but a pattern that emerges from React compositional nature. 
    They are similar to JavaScript functions used for adding additional functionalities to the existing component.

A higher order component function accepts another function as an argument.
 The map function is the best example to understand this. 
 The main goal of this is to decompose the component logic into simpler and smaller functions that can be reused as you need.
 //Function Creation  
 function add (a, b) {  
   return a + b  
 }  
 function higherOrder(a, addReference) {  
   return addReference(a, 20)  
 }  
 //Function call  
 higherOrder(30, add) // 50
