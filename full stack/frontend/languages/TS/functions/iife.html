    <h1>Iife Function</h1>
    <p>
        An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that runs the moment it is invoked or called in the JavaScript event loop.
         Having a function that behaves that way can be useful in certain situations. 
        IIFEs prevent pollution of the global JS scope
        One key feature is the ability for a function to also be assigned to a variable. Consider the following example
        const myFunction = function greeting() {
            return "Hello";
           };
           
    </p>
