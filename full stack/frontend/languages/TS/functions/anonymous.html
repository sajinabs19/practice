    <h1> Anonymous Function</h1>
    <p>
        The meaning of the word 'anonymous' defines something that is unknown or has no identity. 
        In JavaScript, an anonymous function is that type of function that has no name or we can say which is without any name.
        When we create an anonymous function, it is declared without any identifier.
        const EnumType = {
            variable = function () {
            function body
         };
         // to call the function variable()
         In the above syntax, we can see that the function keyword is being used but there is no name. 
         The final function is returned to a variable. This variable can be used as the function. 
         Moreover, we can also assign the same to some other variable which then can be used as a function. 
         Let us see one example for better understanding.
