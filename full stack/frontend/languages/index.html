    <h1><U>FRONT END LANGUAGES</U></h1>
    <p>JavaScript, CSS, React, and HTML are the widely recognized front end languages. 
        On the other hand, all operations that are related to the 'server-side' refer to the backend. 
        These backend operations could be about updating databases, scripting codes & APIs, and building libraries etc.</p>
