    <h1>paragraph</h1>
    <p>
        In HTML p element defines a paragraph. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph. <br>
        Paragraphs belong to a class of elements called block-level elements. These elements start on a fresh line and may take up the entire width of the page or its container. Paragraphs are styled with CSS.
    </p>
    <span> The span tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.<br>
         The span tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.</span>
