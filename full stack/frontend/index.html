    <h1><U>FRONT END</U></h1><br>
    <p>A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications. 
        The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works. 
        You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.
        A front-end developer is a type of software developer who specializes in creating and designing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and web applications.
        The primary responsibility of a front-end developer is to ensure that the visual and interactive aspects of a website or application are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and functionally efficient.
</p>
<h2>Front-end developers work with various technologies, tools, and languages, including:</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./languages/index.html">LANGUAGES</a></li>
        <li><a href="./framework/bootstrap/index.html">FRAMEWORK</a></li>
        <li><a href="">LIBRARIES</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Front-end developers may also use libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, to streamline their work and create more sophisticated and interactive UIs. Additionally, they often collaborate with back-end developers, who are responsible for the server-side logic and data management, to ensure seamless integration between the front-end and back-end components of a web application or website.</p>
