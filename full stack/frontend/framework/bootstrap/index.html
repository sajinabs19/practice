    <h1><u>FRAME WORK</u></h1>
    <P>
        Frameworks are a valuable tool for developing applications. 
        But, before you get started with frameworks, it's best to have a solid understanding of a programming language. For example, JavaScript is used in many frameworks. 
        It's a powerful, flexible programming language
        The purpose of a framework is to assist in the development, providing standard, low-level functionality so that developers can focus efforts on the elements that make the project unique.
         High-quality, pre-vetted functionality increases software reliability, speeds up programming time, and simplifies testing
